# .NET Core containers

## Prerequisites

Install the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

If you have .NET Core installed, use the `dotnet --info` command to determine which SDK you're using.

## Test the app

In the **app** folder, we have already provided a simple .NET Core console application.

To test the app type:

```console
$ dotnet run --project app
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
...
```
The application runs indefinitely and counts numbers every second. To exit from the app use the cancel command CTRL+C.

## Publish the app

```console
$ dotnet publish -c Release app
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.4.0+e901037fe for .NET Core
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  myapp -> .../SNY.OSS.CTR.01.01.00/labs/05-.NET_Core_containers/app/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/publish/
```

## Build the image

Let's build a .NET Core-based image with your application packed within.

```console
$ docker build -t net-image:1.0 -f Dockerfile .

Check the involved images 

```console
$ docker images | grep net
net-image                                                               1.0                        9ea6d00a1843        7 minutes ago       190MB

```

Run a container from your image

```console
$ docker run  net-image:1.0
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
Counter: 6
...
```

To exit from the container use the cancel command CTRL+C.

# Expose Deployments using Services

1) Break down the assignment n. 5 (Kubernetes Deployment) to have two Deployments, each one with a single container within (one form MySQL and the other for Wordpress).

2) Each Deployment must be exposed using Services (NodePort for wordpress, ClusterIP for MySQL)

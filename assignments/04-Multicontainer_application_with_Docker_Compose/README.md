# Multicontainer application with Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Use Docker Compose to resemble the Wordpress application described in the **assignment 02** in a single docker-compose.yaml file.

The application should then start with the command:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

Please refer to the Docker Compose reference at https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
